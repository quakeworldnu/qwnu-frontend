                    <h1>About Quake and QuakeWorld</h1>
                    <p>
                        Quake is a first-person shooter video game and was released by id Software in 1996.
                        It was the first game in the popular <b>Quake</b> series of video games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To improve the quality of online play, id Software released <b>QuakeWorld</b> on December 17, 1996,
                        a build of Quake that featured significantly revamped network code.

                        In December 1999, John Carmack of id Software released the server and client source code of Quake and QuakeWorld
                        under the GNU General Public License as a Christmas present to the world, and this spawned a plethora of 21st
                        century updates to the game. With the source code released, Quake has branced off in several modern clients which
                        each brings various features and improvements.

                        In 2007 Quake was honored at the 59th Annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for advancing
                        the art form of user modifiable games.

                    <p>
                        Many years after its original release, Quake is still regarded by many critics as one of the greatest
                        and most influential games ever made. It is considered even today by many die-hard players to be the
                        best multiplayer game with its fast paced action and fun gameplay.
